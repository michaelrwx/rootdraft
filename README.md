# rootdraft
For the game Root by Leder Games, this is a program designed to simplify Advanced Setup Drafts by randomizing each of the classes based on player count.

Written in Python, this application focuses on PyQt6 as its primary means of displaying GUI.

If a Vagabond is chosen, there is an option to randomize the class as well. Obviously with this being a board game, that can be used to your discretion.

This project is WIP.

TODO:
- Make the program work
- Turn this into an executible file
